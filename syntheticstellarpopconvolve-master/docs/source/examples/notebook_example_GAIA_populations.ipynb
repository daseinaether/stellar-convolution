    "In this notebook we show how to convolve data to predict gaia-observable populations for the present time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several ingredients are necessary here:\n",
    "- population-synthesis results that contain counts of star systems at particular times\n",
    "- a Milky-Way galaxy star formation rate history model\n",
    "- a method to sample the positions (/distances to sun) and on-sky angles of the star systems\n",
    "- a model to model binary orbit properties like projected distance. We will make use of [Dyad](https://github.com/amerygration/dyad).\n",
    "- a model to assign detection probabilities for the gaia survey. We will make use of [GaiaUnlimited](https://gaiaunlimited.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work towards a single epoch observation in this notebook. Further sophistications like multi-epoch observation of the same systems to identify their binary character is not covered here (yet). Moreover, we will use a single-metallicity population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution broadly is done as follows:\n",
    "- calculate the formation yields of star systems that would exit at present day \n",
    "- Calculate detection probabilities for the rest based on their position (either randomly assigned or motivated by a spatially-defined SFH) in the Milkyway and their system properties. For this we make use of [GaiaUnlimited](https://gaiaunlimited.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use this information to predict observable populations for the GAIA survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to consider:\n",
    "- The total stellar mass in a galaxy is large, so if one tries to model too many types of stellar systems, the output will be large too.\n",
    "- To avoid being overloaded with data, you should either filter out systems of lesser interest before the convolution"
