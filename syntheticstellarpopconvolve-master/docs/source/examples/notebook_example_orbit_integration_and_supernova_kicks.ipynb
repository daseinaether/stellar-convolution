    "As stars form in larger systems like galaxies, they also move through these systems over time. \n",

    "Whether we can connect such an evolution with SSPC depends on whether the sysstem is collisionless and does not involve dynamical scatterings. \n",

    "In collissionless systems, the position and velocity of a star system (or its centre of mass) is dictated by the collisionless boltzmann equation. On top of this motion, massive stars can also experience kicks due to supernovae. \n",

    "This notebook intends to show how to set up a post-convolution method that evolves te position and velocity of a (binary) star system under the influence of the gravitational field of a galaxy, as well as additional supernova kicks. We will use [AGAMA](https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/Agama) ([Vasiliev 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2019MNRAS.482.1525V/doi:10.1093/mnras/sty2672)) for this, but other codes could be used too."
