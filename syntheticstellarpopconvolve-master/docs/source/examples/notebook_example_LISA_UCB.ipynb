    "This example fleshes out the steps required to estimate the population of observable double white dwarf systems in the LISA band. Relevant studies are: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20484\n",
    "\n",
    "Several ingredients are necessary here:\n",
    "- population-synthesis results that contain white-dwarfs\n",
    "- a Milky-Way galaxy star formation rate history model\n",
    "- a method to evolve double white-dwarf under the influence of gravitational wave radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution-by-sampling was developed especially for this project, as we want to 'generate' double white dwarf systems at a certain lookback time, and evolve them (through gravitational-wave radiation) to the present day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution broadly is done as follows:\n",
    "- In a given lookback-time bin we calculate the total mass formed into stars\n",
    "- We use that to generate double white dwarf systems (using mass_formed * yield-per-mass-formed) \n",
    "- We assign a birth time to these systems (with values bound by the edges of the lookback time bin)\n",
    "- We 'evolve' these systems up to the current day under the influence of gravitational-wave radiation. We make use of Legwork ([Wagg et al 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260...52W/abstract)) in this example.\n",
    "- Filter out certain systems (in particular those that, at current-day, are not in the LISA waveband)\n",
    "- Calculate detection probabilities for the rest based on their position (either randomly assigned or motivated by a spatially-defined SFH) in the Milkyway and their system properties.\n",
    "- Use this information to predict observable populations of DWD systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook I will show how to set up all the necessary pieces for this script and how to put them together. We will start some general imports like usual, then continue with setting up the `sfr_dict`, then design the post convolution function, and then combine everything and run the convolution."
