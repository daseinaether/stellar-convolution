    "In the above sections we have focussed mostly on the aspects of evolving stars (synthetically), and sampling distributions properly to reflect realistic populations of stars. However, in order to actually create realistic synthetic populations, with hard predictions of the numbers of (particular types of) e.g. stars, rates, or integrated nucleosynthetic yields, we still need to perform two important steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to assign a ``normalized yield'', $Y_{i}$, to each of the systems, which encodes the number of actual star-systems represented by each system \\textit{i} that are formed for every solar mass formed in stars. This normalized yield is calculated as,\n",

    "  \\label{eq:normalized_yield} Y_{i} = \\frac{p_{i}}{\\left<M\\right>}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\left<M\\right>$ represents the \\textit{average} mass of \\textit{any} stellar system (regardless of its multiplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional MC sampling $Y_{i}$ is the same for each star as $p_{i}$ is just 1 over the number of stars in the synthetic population, but for grid-based sampling or adaptive-importance sampling it can be different for different systems, as $p_{i}$ is assigned to the systems beforehand based on the initial distributions, and possibly the adapted distribution.\n",
    "% evolution splitting\n",
    "Another possible cause of unequal probabilities is the use of ``evolution splitting'', which is the process of splitting a stellar evolution process into a number of child processes that each sample a stochastic process, like supernova natal-kicks, differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to combine the normalized yields of the systems with a star formation history, which is often expressed as a star-formation rate (SFR) in $M_{\\odot}\\ yr^{-1}$ at a given lookback-time $t_{\\mathrm{lookback}}$. We determine the total mass formed between $t_{\\mathrm{lookback}}-\\Delta t/2$ and $t_{\\mathrm{lookback}}+\\Delta/2$ then as $SFR(t_{\\mathrm{lookback}})*\\Delta t$. To determine the total number of stars like system $i$, with a certain age $t_{\\mathrm{age}}$, in a current-day population given a star formation history we combine the total mass formed at that the lookback time corresponding to the age of the stars with the normalized yield as,\n",
