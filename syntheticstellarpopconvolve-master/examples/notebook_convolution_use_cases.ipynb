    "One thing that is not taken into account is the torques on the binary system due to the background potential of the galaxy (nor any dynamical interactions, but lets go with the collissionless assumption of galaxies for now). These torques would alter their evolution and can not really be added post-processing. To be fully correct would need to be taken into account during the simulation of the binary system, but that means we need to evolve these systems `on-the-fly`, during the convolution, instead of using pre-simulated sets of population-synthesis results.\n",
