By performing the convolution sequentially, with a single core, we are able to store and pass information to the next convolution step.\n",

    "While keeping track of some data during the convolution itself, unless any derived quantity from this data can affect the next timestep (be it total star formation rate, metallicity distribution, etc), this functionality is somewhat limited in its use-case potential. In future releases we plan to allow, in certain circumstances, to have the user update certain global and star-formation specific properties during the convolution."
