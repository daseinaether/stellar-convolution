# Synthetic Stellar Population Convolution (SSBC) Tool by David Hendriks
SSPC is a post-processing tool for analyzing datasets produced by stellar population synthesis programs, such as COMPAS.

This project aims to further development and improvement to the SSPC code, originally written by David Hendriks.
Key elements from the original codebase have been migrated from GitLabs to facilitate a focused and controlled development environment.
