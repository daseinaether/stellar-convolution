# Synthetic Stellar Population Convolution (SSPC) Tool by David Hendriks
SSPC is a post-processing tool for analyzing datasets produced by stellar population synthesis programs, such as COMPAS.
It is designed to be a generalized convolution layer that can accept various different population synthesis outputs.

This project aims to continue further development on David Hendriks' SSPC code.
Key elements from the original codebase have been migrated from GitLabs to facilitate a focused and controlled development environment.
